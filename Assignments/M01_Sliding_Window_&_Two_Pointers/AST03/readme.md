# Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters

## Problem Statement
```
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s​​​​​, return the number of good substrings of length three in s​​​​​​.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s​​​​​​ consists of lowercase English letters.
```
### Example
```
Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1

Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4

Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
